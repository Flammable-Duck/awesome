My awesomewm configs, absolute shit lol.

I am working on making this slightly less absolute shit.

Run setup.sh to get the widgets, and install some programs used by awesome

clone my [wallpaper directory](https://github.com/Flammable-Duck/wallpapers) if you want my wallpapers

you should probably use the Dracula theme with this.
